    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable toggles mouse input filtering. When set to &quot;1&quot;, the values which<br />are received from the mouse&#39;s input will first be averaged together and then <br />that value will be used in the game. <br />The reason for this command is that some mice had problems with sending sporadic<br />coordinates which make the input from the mouse jerky, also when using a serial <br />or PS/2 mouse, the Windows operating system will only sample mouse input every <br />25ms, that is 40 times a second (for USB mice the sample rate is 125 Hz, that is<br />every 8 ms). When set to &quot;1&quot; this variable will smooth out the input but it will <br />cause latency between the movement of the mouse and the actual response in the <br />game. When using a PS/2 mouse it is thus first recommended to try to increase <br />the sampling rate either by changing it via your mouse driver or by using the <br />ps2rate program which can be downloaded at ps2rate homepage . <br />If you are playing the game at frame rates above 40 FPS and if you can&#39;t <br />increase the sampling rate of your PS/2 rate or if you are playing with a serial <br />mouse it is recommended that you enable this toggle.</div></div>
