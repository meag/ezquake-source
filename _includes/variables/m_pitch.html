    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable sets the level of precision when the mouse is used to make the <br />player look up and down while the +mlook command is in effect. By default this <br />variable is set in such a way that moving the mouse forward makes the player <br />look up and moving the mouse backward makes the player look down. Some people <br />prefer to have this movement inverted just like it is inverted for airplane <br />controls. If you wish to use this inverted mouse movement then you should set <br />this variable to a negative value (for example &quot;-0.022&quot;). It is a matter of <br />preference which movement method is used by players. Also lowering the value <br />for this variable will increase the level of precision when the mouse is used <br />to make the player look up and down. This variable can be used separately from <br />the sensitivity variable to provide greater control over the mouse sensitivity <br />for movement along the pitch. It is advisable to keep the value for this <br />variable constant at 0.022 or -0.022 and instead use the sensitivity variable <br />to change the overall sensitivity of the mouse. Also, some script writers lower <br />the value for this variable along with a lowered value for the fov variable in <br />order to provide more precision when the fov variable is used to zoom.</div></div>
