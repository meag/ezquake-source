    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable will toggle the clearing of the screen between each frame. This<br />can be helpful when specing a game and flying out of the map or during map <br />development when the map maker must fly outside of the map to look has his map<br />from the outside. Enabling this command will clear the areas which are not <br />rendered outside of the map thus preventing the flickering effect when images <br />repeat themselves repeatedly. However it causes problems when playing and <br />going through the surfaces of a liquid (for example when diving into liquid), as<br />you will see a red flash where the liquid texture would normally be repeated.</div></div>
