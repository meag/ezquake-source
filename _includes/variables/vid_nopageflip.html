    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable toggles the use of page-flipping during supported video modes. By <br />default the game will allow for page-flipping for video modes that support this <br />feature. For example if a given VESA mode can support page flipping, then it <br />defaults to page-flipped operation.  A VESA mode can be forced to <br />non-page-flipped operation by setting the &quot;vid_nopageflip&quot; variable to &quot;1&quot;, then<br />setting the mode (note that &quot;vid_nopageflip&quot; takes operation on the next, <br />not the current video mode, and note that it then stays in effect permanently, <br />even when the client is exited and restarted, unless it is manually set back to &quot;0&quot;).<br />If there is not enough memory for two pages in a VESA mode, or if the adapter <br />doesn&#39;t support page flipping, then the mode will automatically be <br />non-page-flipped.  <br />Page-flipping works by drawing multiple virtual game screens at the same time in <br />the video memory and then switching among them to display the current <br />gamescreen. Page-flipped modes thus use less system memory than non-page-flipped <br />modes, but require more video memory. When using page-flipping, visual quality <br />may be higher, but performance of the game can change to better or worse, <br />depending on the graphics adapter and other hardware (see the discussion of the <br />Pentium Pro below, for a discussion of why page flipping can be faster but is <br />sometimes much slower on that processor). However in most cases the performance <br />(and thus frame rate) will be increased, but for people with hardware that has <br />problems with page-flipping &quot;vid_nopageflip 1&quot; may help.<br />The Pentium Pro is an example for such a hardware: it is an okay client platform (sniff!), <br />but it has one weak spot, it is by default very slow on writes to video memory.  <br />This means that in default hardware configurations, you are usually much better <br />off setting &quot;vid_nopageflip&quot; to &quot;1&quot; if you use VESA modes, so drawing is done to <br />system memory instead of to video memory. Remember that you must set the mode<br />after setting &quot;vid_nopageflip&quot; to &quot;1&quot; in order to get &quot;vid_nopageflip&quot; to take<br />effect. &quot;vid_nopageflip 1&quot; can sometimes be faster on a Pentium too, but not by <br />nearly as much in general, and it&#39;s often slower.</div></div>
