    <div class="doc-row remarks"><div>Remarks:</div><div>It&#39;s a bad idea to use watervis 1 if the maps the server is using are not watervised. Liquids will appear &#39;transparent&#39; but you won&#39;t be able to see any items/players/etc through it.  And it is a bad idea anyway because Quake maps were not designed for transparent water (or other liquids); enabling it changes gameplay, decreases fps and produces more network traffic and puts non-GL players at a disadvantage because the software renderer doesn&#39;t support transparent water (yet).<br />Not saved to config with cfg_save command.</div></div>
