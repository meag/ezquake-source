This variable is used when cl_independentphysics 1 is set, and controls the FPS sent/received to/from the server. The graphical FPS is limited by cl_maxfps (vid_vsync must be 0). When set to 0, the current cl_maxfps value is used. When cl_maxfps is set to 0 too, client displays as much FPS as server and data rate allows.</div></div>
