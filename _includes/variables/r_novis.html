    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable toggles the use of VIS information from the map data. When this <br />variable is set to &quot;1&quot; the game will calculate it&#39;s own VIS information on the <br />fly instead of using the information stored in the map data, this will cause <br />a severe performance penalty in the game. When &quot;r_novis&quot; is set to &quot;1&quot;, the <br />variable &quot;gl_turbalpha&quot; has a value lower than &quot;1&quot; and the server allows the<br />client to display liquid transparently the player will be able to see through <br />liquids. This is a nice effect to see but it is not recommended to keep this <br />variable set to &quot;1&quot; because of the huge performance penalty. <br />It is possible to enable transparent liquids and still keep this variable set to<br />&quot;0&quot; (and thus not experience such a severe performance drop) by using maps that<br />are VISed accordingly. You can visit the official Water VIS site at <br />&quot;http://www.sod.net/&quot; and download the vispatch program along with the patch <br />data files which you would use to update the VIS data for all of your game maps.<br />There are also map packs available that contain VISed versions of the original<br />ID maps.</div></div>
