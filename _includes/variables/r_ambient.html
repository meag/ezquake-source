When this <br />variable is increased the map will become brighter and all walls and objects <br />will be rendered in a lighter color.<br />It was removed in QWCL and has been re-introduced in this client, however it <br />can only be used when the server is running with cheats enabled (for example <br />&quot;qwsv -cheats&quot;), because it could be used as a cheat by making it easier to see<br />players in dark corners when no fullbright skins are used.</div></div>
