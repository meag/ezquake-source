    <div class="doc-row description"><div>Description:</div><div>This variable controls how fast the player should move forward and back when the <br />mouse is moved forward and back. This command has no effect if the +mlook <br />command is in effect because when the mouse is moved forward and back the <br />player looks up and down instead of moving forward and back. Some players might <br />want to set this variable to &quot;0&quot; if they happen not to use +mlook constantly and <br />they only want to use the mouse to turn the player. Setting this variable to &quot;0&quot;<br />will prevent the inadvertent movement of the player forward and back while <br />trying to make precise turns with the mouse.</div></div>
