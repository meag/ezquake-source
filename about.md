### History ###

[id Software](http://idsoftware.com) created Quake in 1996.  They released the source code to the engine in 1999 under the terms of the GPL licence, and new versions were created.  Tonik developed the ZQuake QuakeWorld client, before fuh took ZQuake and turned it into FuhQuake.

The ezQuake project started in August 2004 as a derivative of FuhQuake, and today is the dominant QuakeWorld client for playing competitively online.
